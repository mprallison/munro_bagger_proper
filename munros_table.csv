It is in the heart of the Fisherfield Forest and is a truly stunning viewpoint - steep mountains rise abruptly from the surrounding lochs and bogs whilst a huge sweep of the sea is over to the west.",https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/ruadh-stac-mor,57.726781,-5.329288
m273,A' Ghlas-bheinn,Kintail,918m,A' Ghlas-bheinn is a rough and rocky little mountain that is well seen from near Morvich in Kintail. Its ascent can easily be combined with a visit to the famous Falls of Glomach.,https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/a-ghlas-bheinn,57.255081,-5.303686
m274,Sgùrr a' Mhadaidh,Isle of Skye,918m,"Sgùrr a' Mhadaidh has four summits on one of the trickier sections of the Cuillin Ridge - the highest one, which is the only Munro, is the only one that can be ascended without rock-climbing. The usual ascent is via An Dorus but there is an easier option which leaves the gully before reaching the bealach.",https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/sgurr-a-mhadaidh,57.230868,-6.231947
m275,Geal-chàrn (Drumochter),Cairngorms,917m,"There are several Geal Chàrns; this one is on the north side of the Drumochter Pass. It is a rounded dome which can be quickly reached from Balsporran Cottages, and formerly had a line of very prominent cairns some distance short of its summit.",https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/geal-charn-drumochter,56.874433,-4.304519
m276,Creag nan Dàmh,Kintail,918m,Creag nan Dàmh is the final peak on the South Glen Shiel Ridge. It only just qualifies as a Munro and appears insignificant compared to some of its neighbours.,https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/creag-nan-damh,57.147262,-5.33496
m277,Meall na Teanga,Fort William,918m,"Meall na Teanga is a steep dome, one of the two Loch Lochy Munros, rising above the forestry as seen from the A82 on the opposite side of the loch. Its rounded summit has several satellite peaks, divided by scooped coires.",https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/meall-na-teanga,56.98903,-4.93094
m278,Beinn a' Chlèibh,Argyll,916m,"Beinn a' Chlèibh only just makes Munro status and is overshadowed by its far more celebrated neighbour Ben Lui, with which it is usually climbed. It presents forbiddingly steep slopes to Glen Lochay.",https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/beinn-a-chleibh,56.39023,-4.83563
m279,Ben Vane,Loch Lomond,915m,"One of the Arrochar Alps, Ben Vane only just makes Munro status but has great character, with very steep and rocky slopes on all sides. Bealachs with other peaks are very low and Ben Vane is usually climbed on its own.",https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/ben-vane,56.249786,-4.781655
m280,Càrn Aosda,Cairngorms,917m,"Càrn Aosda is one of the easiest and quickest Munros to climb, but that is its only distinction. The mountain has been heavily developed for ski-ing and pistes, tows and access tracks disfigure its slopes above the Cairnwell pass.",https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/carn-aosda,56.895696,-3.423274
m281,Beinn Teallach,Fort William,915m,Beinn Teallach was once the highest of the Corbetts before being promoted be one of the smallest Munros. It has steep ground on its eastern side but lacks any real distinction.,https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/beinn-teallach,56.935932,-4.694754
